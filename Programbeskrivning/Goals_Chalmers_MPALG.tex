% Goals for "Computer Science --- Algorithms, Languages and Logic"
\meta{Version 2011-08-31 by Peter Damaschke.}

% This is in a separate file to make it easy to include from both the
% MPALG and TKDAT programme descriptions.

After completion of their studies, the students shall be able to
\begin{itemize}
\item apply solid knowledge in the mathematical and logical
  foundations of computing, including aspects like tractability,
  complexity, correctness, and safety,
\item create models that are both meaningful and amenable to analysis,
  thereby choosing the right level of abstraction,
\item develop correct and efficient computer programmes and systems
  that satisfy given requirements under given constraints,
\item analyse and test systems, evaluate, predict, prove and verify
  their essential properties,
\item identify and handle complex computational problems, also within
  project work, 
\item communicate their ideas and results to both specialists and
  nonspecialists, give structured and scholarly presentations in oral
  and written form,
\item find scientific information and integrate knowledge, identify
  their own needs for gathering further knowledge and do the necessary
  self-study,
\item work in international environments,
\item critically judge systems, results, and the use of information
  technology also from a social point of view, and be aware that
  results of computations crucially depend on model assumptions.
\end{itemize}

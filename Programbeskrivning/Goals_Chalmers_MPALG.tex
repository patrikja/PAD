Computer systems are becoming increasingly powerful and intelligent,
and they rely on increasingly sophisticated techniques. To master the
complexity of these systems it is essential to understand the core
areas of computer science. While computer systems and their
applications develop rapidly, the underlying foundations of computing
are mature mathematical theories.

This programme offers a comprehensive foundation in the science of
programming and computing, thus providing lasting knowledge in the
field. It gives the student a strong basis for developing the computer
applications of today and tomorrow and for conducting innovative
research and promoting development.

After completion of their studies, the students will be able to
\begin{itemize}
\item apply solid knowledge in the mathematical and logical
  foundations of computing, to computational problems appearing, e.g.,
  in industry and the public sector, thereby taking into account
  aspects like tractability, complexity, correctness, and security,
\item create models of real-world scenarios that are both meaningful
  and amenable to analysis, thereby choosing the right level of
  abstraction,
\item develop correct and efficient computer programmes and systems
  that satisfy given requirements under given constraints,
\item analyse and test systems, evaluate, predict, prove and verify
  their essential properties,
\item identify and handle complex computational problems,
\item communicate their ideas and results to both specialists and
  nonspecialists, give structured and scholarly presentations in oral
  and written form,
\item find scientific information and integrate knowledge, identify
  their own needs for gathering further knowledge and do the necessary
  self-study,
\item work in project groups and international environments, take a
  leading role,
\item critically judge systems, results, and the use of information
  technology also from a social point of view, and be aware that
  results of computations crucially depend on model assumptions.
\end{itemize}
